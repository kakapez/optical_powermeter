Python code for communicating with our home build power meter

The main.py implements Kivy so the powermeter can used from an android tablet, though it does require the tablet to have root access so you can get access to the serial port. 

powermeter.py contains the commands to connect and communicate with the powermeter. 

The code is currently very basic but does function

Features to implement include:

Auto range 

Max and min values

Power logging

Better graphing
